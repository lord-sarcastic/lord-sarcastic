# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Lord_Sarcastic; Python conjurer, Rust chaser, writer and admirer of scary and unimaginable tales. I argue for fun and play the piano in the poorest and most untalented manner possible.

## On matters pertaining to sleep
```
Sleep is the invincible image of rest
The firstborn over all recreations
For by it, every activity is rated
That are on earth and beneath its form
The anaerobic and the aerobic
```

## On matters partaining to strength
```
In the birthing hours of each day
Upon the shoulders of sleep, the weak have made hay
Alas, the night will suffer not to stay
For the strong would remain awake, come what may
```
